### 🧠 MLXVLM Dependency & Build Resolution (qwen-vlm)

- **Dependency Alignment**: Verified and fixed the `MLXVLM` dependency resolution within the `qwen-vlm` worktree.
- **API Migration**: Updated `LocalLLMService.swift` to align with the latest `mlx-swift-lm` (main branch) API changes.
  - Replaced the deprecated `VLMModelContainer` with the unified `ModelContainer` type.
  - Refactored `UserInput` initialization to correctly embed images within `Chat.Message` objects, fulfilling the new structured input requirements.
- **Code Quality & Modernization**:
  - Resolved a compiler warning in `ReceiptSorterCore.swift` by removing an unnecessary `nonisolated(unsafe)` attribute from the `authService` property (now correctly identified as `Sendable`).
- **Validation**:
  - Confirmed successful compilation with `swift build` (warning-free).
  - Verified core functionality with `swift test`, passing all 6 tests in the `ReceiptSorterCore` suite.
- **Version Control**: Committed and pushed all fixes to the `feat/qwen-vlm` remote branch.

- **Legal Compliance & Headers**:
  - Created `COPYRIGHT-HEADER.txt` as a standard template for the project.
  - Developed and executed a script to **apply copyright headers to all 40+ Swift source files** and test files across the repository.
  - Headers include project name, copyright holder (OJD Technical Solutions), SPDX identifier (AGPL-3.0-or-later), and a note on commercial licensing availability.
- **Documentation Updates**:
  - Refined the "License" section in READMEs to mention the availability of commercial licensing for enterprises.

### 🎨 Standard SwiftUI Adoption (ADR-001)

- **Complete Design System Migration**: Successfully migrated the entire macOS application from the custom "Liquid Glass" design system to native SwiftUI components.
  - **Phase 1 - Primary Views**: Refactored `OnboardingView.swift`, `ModernSettingsView.swift`, `ContentView.swift`, and `DuplicateReviewView.swift`.
    - Replaced 20 `LGButton` instances with standard `Button` + `.buttonStyle(.borderedProminent/.bordered)`.
    - Replaced 9 `LGTextField` instances with `TextField`/`SecureField` + `.textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)`.
    - Replaced 8 `LGGroupBox` instances with standard `GroupBox`.
    - Replaced 6 `LGCard` instances with `GroupBox`.
    - Updated 40+ typography references from `LiquidGlassTypography.*` to standard `.font()` modifiers.
    - Removed custom modifiers: `.lgSidebarStyle()`, `.glassSurface()`.
    - Applied `.privacySensitive()` to all sensitive `SecureField` inputs.
  - **Phase 2 - Complete Cleanup**: Removed all remaining Liquid Glass dependencies.
    - Created `WelcomeView.swift`: Streamlined 212-line welcome screen (replaced 411-line `LGWelcomeView`).
    - Added `ProcessingItemRow` and `DataCard` helper views inline in `ContentView.swift`.
    - **Deleted entire `DesignSystem` directory** (13 files removed):
      - Components: `LGButton`, `LGCard`, `LGDataCard`, `LGGroupBox`, `LGProcessingItemRow`, `LGSidebar`, `LGTextField`, `LGWelcomeView`.
      - Core: `Animations`, `Colors`, `Materials`, `Shadows`, `Typography`.
- **Migration Impact**:
  - 27 files modified across 2 commits.
  - 1,606 lines added, 1,700 lines deleted (net -94 lines).
  - Zero Liquid Glass dependencies remaining.
  - Build time: 8.14s, All 6 tests passing.
- **Documentation**: Created ADR-001 documenting the architectural decision, updated status to "Accepted".
- **Result**: Application now uses 100% native macOS SwiftUI throughout, with improved maintainability, better accessibility, and reduced codebase complexity.
